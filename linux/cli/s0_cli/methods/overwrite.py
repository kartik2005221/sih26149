"""Overwrite-based wipe — the one method fully exercisable in this environment.

Works identically on block devices and image files because both are byte
addressable through open()/write()/fsync(). On an image file the bytes really
do land on the underlying disk; on a block device they go to the drive. What
overwrite can NEVER claim is Purge: host writes cannot reach sectors the drive
has remapped away (growing defect lists, SSD overprovision). That limit is
physics/firmware policy, not tooling effort, so the tier stays Clear.
